> PumpLion, the cheerful lion mascot of osu!gaming CTF, has been deployed as a "super-secure" chatbot for event participants. Rumor has it... the flag is hidden deep in its silicon jungle. But don't expect it to just hand it to you on a silver platter - it's been "prompt-trained" to protect it at all costs.
