## R3CTF 2025 Writeup

### Challenge Name: `r3craft`

This was one of the Misc challanges in the R3CTF 2025, and only about 20 teams solved it, giving it the dynamic weightage of 680 points. (Making it technically the hardest challenge that I have solved thus far!) Here's the challenge description:

>Here, r3girl awakes in a narrow yard, surrounded by cold stone walls and silent watchers bound to r3kapig's will, punishing anything that dares to defy physics. The walls arenâ€™t impossibly tall, but just high enough to stop a normal jump.

>They say escape lies not in brute force, but in stepping that bends the rules ever so slightly.
>WEE-OO WEE-OO WEE-OO! Subject has escaped!
